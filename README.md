# A Tactical Media Site Experience and Interaction Course Project
The subject matter is mutual concession and compromise, and to explore this concept, I
created a website called Réalisation Jeans that fosters a new experience around an age-old proverb: you get what you give. 
Described as “the positive correlation between the effort one puts in and the benefits one receives” by Definitions.com, 
the rule of give-and-take is a natural framework of society. However, we’ve realized that people, 
especially young adults who depend on their guardians, tend to ignore this principle and take services and labor for granted. 
We think too much for ourselves and not enough about how our actions may influence others, and what we don’t realize is that 
this rigid dichotomy between selfishness and selflessness impacts everyone around us.
As a tactical media project, I have made a website to acknowledge this pattern of taking things for granted. 
The website is a standard, run-of-the-mill online shopping space where users can browse clothing. 
However, pop-up ads for an electric company requesting funds to keep their business afloat will interrupt the user’s shopping experience. 
The instinctive response is to immediately click out and keep shopping, but to reflect our concept of give-and-take, 
every time the user clicks out, their electricity gets weaker, represented by their laptop’s brightness dimming. 
If the website viewer declines to donate enough times, their laptop “dies”, as the electric company’s business has folded 
and can no longer supply the electricity that the user charges their laptop with, simulating an experience in which a customer 
no longer has access to a service they denied to contribute to.
The aim is to leave website visitors with a different attitude towards the little services and freedoms we all undervalue, 
as we do not see the direct impact they have on us. For example, we are not the ones paying for our internet, hot water, or electricity—usually, 
our parents maintain those luxuries—but once they are gone, we will undeniably suffer in their absence. 
This project shows our audience that while it is natural to ignore problems until we are the ones being affected by them, this ignorance can easily be transformed into appreciation. 
The challenge, then, is to see beyond what has become overfamiliar and acknowledge the efforts that keep our world running.
